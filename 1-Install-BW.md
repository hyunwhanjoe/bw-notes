I used Starcraft Classic Installer to install Brood War 1.16.1 [link](http://www.staredit.net/topic/17625/)  
If you try to find an iso from archive.org you'll have to go through the cd-key checker and have to download patch 1.16.1.  
Though if you look online there are people who reverse engineered the check and it is easily bypassed.  

I remember reading somewhere which recommended installing Starcraft in the C folder if you have SCR installed but I'm still looking for the source.
