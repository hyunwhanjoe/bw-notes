I used Starcraft Classic Installer to install Brood War 1.16.1 [link](http://www.staredit.net/topic/17625/)  
If you try to find an iso from archive.org you'll have to go through the cd-key checker then find and download patch 1.16.1.  
Though if you look online there are people who reverse engineered the check and it is easily bypassed.  
Like from [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdUu65GLo50) a cd key that would work is 1111-22222-3338.  
It seems that the code only checks the last digit of the cd-key and sees if it matches the checksum as summarized by a comment [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b92CW-NZ3l0)  
So it seems that if you just change the last digit you have a 1/10 chance of passing the check.  

I remember reading somewhere which recommended installing Starcraft in the C folder if you have SCR installed but I'm still looking for the source.
