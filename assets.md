BW assets are stored together in [MPQ](https://www.zezula.net/en/mpq/main.html) files.  

They can be found in the StarCraft folder for example BroodWar.mpq.  

[MPQ Editor](https://www.zezula.net/en/mpq/download.html) can be used to view and extract assets in MPQ files.  
I would make a copy of the MPQ file you're viewing.  

If you open BroodWar.mpq you can see smk (video), pcx (image) and wav (audio) files that you can open which get extracted to the Work folder in the folder MPQ editor is in.  

I couldn't view the pcx files with paint but [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/downloads/) was able to view them.
