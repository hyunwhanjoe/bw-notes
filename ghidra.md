# Ghidra Installation
Install ghidra from [link](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases)  
Ghidra needs JDK to run.  
I used this video as a guide to get ghidra running on windows [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IL60yGDbRGw)  
Notes: You need to make a project, drop the executable you want to analyze, click on the ghidra icon/code browser, if nothing shows in the code browser, open the executable by file, open. Afterwards, analyze the executable.  

Video of someone reverse engineering starcraft with ghidra [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJEUxPCUgso&t=26m10s)  
If you want to navigate to an address in the disassembly window, navigation, go to or just press g.
